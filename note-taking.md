# Note Taking

> It took me awhile to realize the perfect note taking solution does not exist. :disappointed:
> We either accept the faults in our system or end up achieving nothing while spending time finding perfection

> Therefore I would recommend anyone just accept whatever system they are using (if it works) and find the joy in using it :smile:

At least the huge amount of time spent on researching methods, tools and software was not completely wasted,
It helped me realize some important things about a note taking system

* What to be noted?
    * is it text?
    * Sound or image?
    * Video perhaps?
    * Etc?
* How to store the information?
    * create new note should be quick
    * note should be available when needed
    * note should be backed up all the time
* How to retrieve the information?
    * find a note should be quick
    * find a text should be quick

## Note Taking Tools

Let breakdown some of the tools to take note

### Pend & Paper

The most simple and minimal form of note taking and it also the best approach for creativity

* One of the greatest inventions of humankind. What more could we ask for?
* Just grab a pen and a paper, write down what we need to remember then we can build a whole library of our own
* Need inspiration? Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGhHjsyfPto

> But as human involve, satisfaction becomes a luxury and quickly this system show its weakness

#### Finding a specific text is not easy in a notebook.

* Use sticky note and break a notebook into section could help
* but still jumping between pages and sections is a chore

#### The number of paper and notebook used to take note keep increasing

* at some points in time, the physical paper will become waste
* too much paper used is also not good for the environment :worried:
* what if you need to search for information that is noted years ago

#### Notebook or paper is easily to be lost or forgotten

#### A serious note taking system is not much portable

* additional tools are required like highlighter pen, rulers, etc
* it also requires multiple notebooks if working on different subjects at the same time

What cannot solve with normal physical tools can be solved with technology ( in a way :smiling_imp: )
which lead us to the next tool

### Ipad & Apple Pencil

After Apple released Apple Pencil, the term "paper less" become more and more popular among students

* It's not a new technology but it's freaking good at what it does (those there are other alternatives as well but I would not recommend any of them)
* It makes people look cool using it :sunglasses:
* Check this video if you need some inspiration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waR3xBDHMqw

> And most important, it solves most of the problems caused by pen & paper while inherit all of the strengths

#### Sound and video note become reality

#### Note and text searching is just a breeze now

#### Handwriting recognition & text to speech

* Now any word can be read out loud with Siri sexy voice ( :smirk: Great power comes great responsibility )

#### Auto sync & backup

* Lost an ipad? A few simple steps away to get back all the notes
* Write a note in ipad and read it on pc (no problem if you use Mac)

#### High portability

* An ipad can store millions of notes and books
* Just grab the ipad and apple pencil and we can create some crazy shit work of art anywhere

#### More trees are saved - Yay :smile:

Looks like a perfect resolution. Not so fast, at least in the perspective of a developer
Which lead to another way of taking note

### The good old laptop

We have encountered the tools with high creativity mindset and embrace different forms of arts

> But when it comes down to efficiency, scalability and the ability to change the world, nothing can beats keyboarding.
> Everybody can be hero with a keyboard :unamused:

Though I do not participate in any war, I too use a keyboard as my main tool for note taking

#### Efficiency

* Typing is much much faster than writing, especially with a good keyboard :relieved:
* Though handwriting recognition is awesome, some handwriting are not meant to be ever recognized by any form of intelligence let alone machine
* The advanced tools for advanced user only available on this platform

#### Scalability

* Imagine if every social media post has to be hand written everytime they are shared
* Imagine if every book has ever published has to be handwritten

Now at this time, it's no surprise that this is my go to note taking system but what about the app to use?

## The search for the perfect note taking app

### The candidates

Below table shows my transition from one app to another (left > right) and the reasons for each transition

| Onenote >                        | Evernote >             | Laverna + Dropbox > | Vim + Dropbox            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| best when use with other MS apps | better UX              | markdown support    | better almost everything |
| lots of advanced features        | better sync            | linux app           |                          |
|                                  | better note management | privacy             |                          |

Other candidates that worth mentioning

* Bear note - https://bear.app
    * Does not have much features than Evernote but IMHO it has a great UX
    * Too bad it only focus on Apple eco system or else I would recommend it to anyone
* Simplenote - https://simplenote.com
    * Minimal UI with markdown support, very easy to use
    * It's just too simple :D
* Dropbox paper - https://www.dropbox.com/paper
    * UI looks great
    * I just don't feel comfortable working with it
* Google Keep - https://keep.google.com
    * Cards are not my style
    * Too simple
* Notion - https://www.notion.so
    * templating is good and it's flexible enough for everyone to add their own touch
    * but I'm too lazy for that
    * It's not free
* Boostnote - https://boostnote.io
    * cool app for developer
    * too bad it's not as good as my current setup
* And lots of other app that I've tried but could not remember

After all of that, I'm starting to see the picture.

> It is the nature of a software to become obsolete, new software will be created to replace the old ones.
> When trying to solve the problems of the old softwares new softwares create more problems of their own

Fortunately, when it seems that everything is lost I finally find the one that worth suffering for :relieved:

### My very opinionated setup

The setup focus only on keeping a minimal note taking system that works
To be honest, this setup has lots of downside :sweat:

* does not support rich text format to display image, or sound and video
* access note on other platforms a part from pc is doable but not as good as other apps
* not easy to share notes with anyone
* require a mindset and habits to make it work effectively (like every other system)

But the strengths outshine all of its weaknesses, at least it works for me

#### Vim as note taking app

> Vim - the text editor to rule them all

In most GUI application. We are all at the mercy of the UI
A TUI application has a complete different phylosophy when it was created

* Because the lack of UI, everything has to be carefully thought out
* only the essential features are available

But why Vim

* The one tool for development and personal note taking
* No more remembering what option in what section in what menu in what UI
    * Now I have to remember the commands and hotkeys :sweat_smile:
* No more hand switching back and forth between mouse and keyboard
    * It's good not using mouse
* Everyone who loves their keyboard should love Vim
    * unless they are Emacs junkies
* A fast editing experience
    * Creating file is super fast
    * Finding file is super fast
    * Finding text in files is super fast
    * Editing text is super fast
    * Support other `text as diagram` tools
* You want to get a glance of how a vim workflow looks? Watch these videos
    * From Sublime to Tmux+Vim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jzWDr24UHQ
    * A quick vim workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z8YbjQvb3s

#### Markdown as note

Rich text format could be interesting at first when they can display images, graphs, play sound or video and other cosmetics enhancements
But you soon realize the ugly truth if you try to copy or import the content to a different application, the format breaks most of the time

Markdown is meant to solve the above problems and it did in a way (it still has problems of it own)
It only cover some basic markup and some may hate that it does not support color but for a lot of people it is enough to cover their workflow

#### Dropbox as sync service, backup & restore

* notes are saved to Dropbox and can be retrieved anytime, anywhere (with a wireless network of course)
* notes can be seen in mobile using dropbox app
